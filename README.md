# JamTemplate

This is just a quick template that includes Kotlin launchers, some fonts for a few different genres, and the platforms LWJGL3 (for desktop) and TeaVM (for web support).

The default behavior is just to semi-randomly select a TextraTypist Font from four predefined ones, and write some sample text with markup.

## Platforms

- `core`: Main module with the application logic shared by all platforms.
- `lwjgl3`: Primary desktop platform using LWJGL3; was called 'desktop' in older docs.
- `teavm`: Web backend that supports most JVM languages.

## Gradle

This project uses [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) to manage dependencies.
The Gradle wrapper was included, so you can run Gradle tasks using `gradlew.bat` or `./gradlew` commands.
Useful Gradle tasks and flags:

- `lwjgl3:jar`: builds application's runnable jar, which can be found at `lwjgl3/build/libs`.
- `lwjgl3:run`: starts the application.
- `teavm:build`: builds the JavaScript application into the build/dist/webapp folder.
- `teavm:run`: serves the JavaScript application at http://localhost:8080 via a local Jetty server.

Note that most tasks that are not specific to a single project can be run with `name:` prefix, where the `name` should be replaced with the ID of a specific project.
For example, `core:clean` removes `build` folder only from the `core` project.
